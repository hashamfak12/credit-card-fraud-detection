# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The analysis and model development were done using Python in Visual Studio Code.
The goal is to explore transaction data, handle class imbalance, and train models that can correctly identify fraudulent activity.

## About the Project

Credit card fraud detection is a real-world classification problem where fraudulent transactions make up a very small portion of the data. This makes the task challenging, as models must detect fraud without incorrectly flagging too many legitimate transactions.
In this project, I analyze the dataset, preprocess the data, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance using standard classification metrics.
